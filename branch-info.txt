This branch adds the option to compute reduced-cost information on all network
links (in-bush and out-of-bush) at each master iteration.  These values can be
used to compute acceptance and rejection gaps for checking path flow
consistency, or adjusting numerical precision on-the-fly.

The first implementation and debugging will be on the serial build (runs are
deterministic, so debugging is easier), before being ported to parallel.
